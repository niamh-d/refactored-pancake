## Concept

KØdo (from Estonian kodu 'home' + English 'do') is pitched as a homelife management solution for busy parents, to facilitate caring for their children via the sharing of important information on the children in the family between guardians, be they primary guardians, extended family guardians (such as grandparents), or temporary guardians (e.g. neighbours, friends).

The idea is for it to be a convenient tool to allow for scheduling of family life and storing of key data points, such as contact information of the children's schools and doctors, child dietary requirements and likes, upcoming appointments and events etc.

## Running

Installation instructions are at the very end of this readme.

1. In the terminal run the below. Don't kill it; let it run.

```
npm start
```

2. In a fresh, second terminal run the below. Don't kill it; let it run.

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

3. In a third terminal run:

```
mysql -u root -p
<enter your mysql password>
USE kodo;
```

Or if you already have set up mysql so you skip entering password:

```
mysql
USE kodo;
```

4. In a fourth terminal run the below. Don't kill it; let it run. This listen for CSS changes in input.css and rebuilds output.css;

```
 npx tailwindcss -i src/index.css -o src/output.css --watch
```

Fin! You are done! Now get back to developing!
